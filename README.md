![Most Profitable products table](https://github.com/julialorrayne/Projects-images/blob/main/superstore/5%20most%20profitable.png?raw=true)
Most of those transactions are in the "technology" category, and they are copiers and binders. Two of the most profitable regions are central. On top of that, most of those transactions are from the customer segment. The company should focus on those categories since they're the most profitable ones.

Sales Amount By Ship Mode
![ship mode sales](https://github.com/julialorrayne/Projects-images/blob/main/superstore/ship%20mode%20sales.png?raw=true)
Although the 'Standard' shipping mode is the most frequently used, the 'Same Day' shipping mode generates the highest sales. The company may want to prioritize both: focusing on the 'Standard' shipping mode to maintain volume and the 'Same Day' mode to maximize profitability.

![sales by ship mode and region](https://github.com/julialorrayne/Projects-images/blob/main/superstore/sales%20by%20ship%20mode%20and%20region.png?raw=true)

Same as frequency of sales, in all regions, Standard Class ship mode generates the highest level of sales, followed by Second Class and then First Class.

The superstore should focus on standard and Second class since those are the ones that generate highest sales.


![monthly sales trend by ship mode](https://github.com/julialorrayne/Projects-images/blob/main/superstore/monthly%20sales%20trend%20by%20ship%20mode.png?raw=true)
There are peaks in sales during certain months, such as 3,5,9,and 11, which could be due to promotional periods, holidays, or seasonal demand.

Profitability does not directly correlate with sales volume alone.
There are some cases where high sales correspond to negative profit, which may indicate inneficiencies.



![correlation matrix](https://github.com/julialorrayne/Projects-images/blob/main/superstore/correlation%20matrix.png?raw=true)
There is a small correlation between Profit and Sales.
There is a negative correlation between Discount and the variables Profit and Sales. The Discount startegies might need to be reviewed and andjusted.

![correlation west](https://github.com/julialorrayne/Projects-images/blob/main/superstore/correlation%20west.png?raw=true)
![correlation central](https://github.com/julialorrayne/Projects-images/blob/main/superstore/correlation%20central.png?raw=true)
![correlation east](https://github.com/julialorrayne/Projects-images/blob/main/superstore/correlation%20east.png?raw=true)

Compared to the other regions, the South region's profit and sales correlation is significantly low. The company might need to review why the volume in sales isn't generating as high profit as the other regions.
